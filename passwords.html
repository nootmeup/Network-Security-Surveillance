<p> Passwords <br> <br>
A password is a string of characters used to verify and grant access to the identity of a user during the authentication process. Passwords are usually used in conjunction to a username;
they are designed to be known only to the user of that account and allow that user to gain access to a device, application or website. Passwords can vary in length and can contain letters, numbers and special characters depending on the website. Other terms that can be used interchangeably
are passphrase for when the password uses more than one word, and passcode and passkey for when the password uses only numbers instead of a mix of characters, such as a personal identification number. <br> <br>
There are multiple ways to keep your password safe: <br> <br>
- Change your password consistently <br>
- Have digital keys in your password <br>
- Don't make your password have obvious combinations such as "123" or "password"
