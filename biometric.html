<p> Biometric <br> <br>
Biometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of individual's physical and behavioral characteristics. This technology is mainly used for identification and access control, or for identifying people that are under severe surveillance.
The whole idea of biometric authentication is that everyone is unique and an individual will be able to be identified by his/her intrinsic physical or behavioral traits.<br><br>
Iris-pattern and retina-pattern authentication methods are already employed in some banks ATMs. Voice waveform recognition is a method of verification that has been used for many decades with tape recordings in telephone wiretaps. It is now being used for access to proprietary databanks in research facilities. Facial-recognition technology has been used by law enforcement to pick out individuals in large crowds with considerable reliability to solve cases. Hand geometry is being used in industry to provide physical access to buildings. Earlobe geometry is being used to disprove the identity of individuals who claim to be someone else, which is commonly known as identity theft. Signature comparison is not as reliable, all by itself, as the other biometric verification methods but offers an extra layer of verification when used in conjunction with one or more other methods.
