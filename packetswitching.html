<p> Packetswitching <br><br>
Packet-switching describes the type of network in which tiny units of data known as "packets" are routed through a network based on the destination address contained within each packet.
Breaking communication down into packets allows the same data path to be shared among other users in the network.
This type of communication between sender and receiver is known as connectionless (rather than wireless). Most traffic over the Internet uses packet switching and the Internet is basically a connectionless network between millions of users.
<br> <br>
Contrasted with packet-switched is circuit-switched, is the regular voice telephone network. This network is where the communication circuit (path) for the call is set up and dedicated to the specific participants in that call. For the duration of the connection, all resources on that circuit are unavailable for other users. Voice calls using the Internet's packet-switched system are possible. Each end of the conversation is broken down into packets that are reassembled at the other end.
