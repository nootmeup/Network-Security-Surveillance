  <br>
  <br>
On Network Security Surveillence, you'll be able to learn everything about Network Security. This website's purpose is to teach you specifically on areas such as; <br>
- Encryption <br>
- Firewalls <br>
- Passwords <br>
- Biometrics <br>
- Packet Switching <br> <br> <br> <br>
However, before learning these things, we must first understand what the term 'Network Security' <br> <br>
The definition of Network Security is: <br>
A network used in industrial and process control industries that provides real-time response to signals for turning off machinery due to a malfunction or operator accident.
<br> <br> Network Security is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying
networking infrastructure from unauthorized access (hacking), misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers,
users and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment.
